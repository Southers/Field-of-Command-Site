# British & Commonwealth WWII Operations: Game Design Reference Document (1940-1945)

This comprehensive reference covers **18 major operations** from the Norwegian Campaign through the Rhine Crossing, providing validated historical data on command structures, unit compositions, terrain considerations, and outcomes suitable for authentic game design implementation.

---

## Executive Summary: Campaign Scope

The British and Commonwealth experience of WWII evolved from desperate defensive evacuations in 1940 to massive combined-arms offensives by 1945. A game following the **battalion → corps progression** aligns well with historical British command structures, though certain operations (commando raids, airborne assaults) operated at smaller scales. The research identifies **four "Tier 1" recurring divisions** suitable as persistent core units and **nine commanders** who served across multiple operations as potential persistent characters.

## British Command Structure (Game Design Reference)

| Level | Strength | Commanded By | Battalions |
|-------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Section** | 7-12 | Corporal/Sergeant | — |
| **Platoon** | 25-30 | Lieutenant | — |
| **Company/Squadron** | 100-120 | Major/Captain | — |
| **Battalion/Regiment*** | 500-1,000 | Lt-Colonel | 1 |
| **Brigade** | 3,500-5,000 | Brigadier | 3 |
| **Division** | 15,000-18,000 | Maj-General | 9 |
| **Corps** | 2-4 Divisions | Lt-General | 18-36 |
| **Army** | Multiple Corps | General | Variable |

***Note**: British cavalry/armoured "regiment" = battalion equivalent

### Infantry Division (1944 Standard)
- 3 Infantry Brigades (each 3 battalions)
- 1 MG Battalion (36 Vickers, 16 4.2" mortars)
- 1 Reconnaissance Regiment
- 3 Field Artillery Regiments (72× 25-pdr total)
- 1 Anti-Tank Regiment (48 guns)
- 1 LAA Regiment (54 Bofors)
- Engineers, signals, medical, supply

### Armoured Division
- 1 Armoured Brigade (3 tank regiments + 1 motor battalion)
- 1 Infantry Brigade (3 battalions)
- Divisional artillery and support

### Game Design Compatibility
The **battalion → corps progression matches British organization well**:
- Battalion = appropriate base tactical unit (~800 men)
- Brigade (3 battalions) = reasonable combined-arms formation
- Division = full combined-arms capability
- Corps = operational-level command

### Exceptions to Note
- **Airborne**: Lighter organization; 75mm pack howitzers
- **Commandos**: Battalion-equivalent "Commandos" (No. 3, No. 4, etc.)
- **Indian Divisions**: Often operated as dispersed brigade groups
- **Special Forces**: Company-sized (LRDG, SAS)

---

## Unit Persistence Story Arcs (Game Design Suggestions)

1. **51st Highland Division**: Redemption arc – surrendered at St-Valéry (June 1940), reconstituted, fought El-Alamein to Berlin, **liberated St-Valéry in September 1944**

2. **7th Armoured Division**: Desert veterans adapting to European warfare – exceptional in North Africa but struggled at Villers-Bocage (June 1944)

3. **4th Indian Division**: Colonial army proving itself across three continents – diverse composition, exceptional combat record

4. **Polish II Corps**: Personal vendetta – former Soviet POWs who escaped via Persia, captured Monte Cassino monastery (May 18, 1944), "Red Poppies of Monte Cassino" composed night before final battle

5. **1st Airborne Division**: Tragic arc – built up through Tunisia/Sicily, destroyed at Arnhem
